# MNIST Library Neural Network



## Usage

Simply compile the code, you will be then given the choice to either Save a new model (Train a new model) or run a test on the one that had already been previously saved.

If you chose to not train a new model the previously saved model will be imediatly compiled so that you can test it for your-self.

A new window will appear where you can chose to start predicting new numbers as well as 'True' or 'False' in the dialog box depending of the model got the rediction right or not

If however you decide to train a new model you will need to decide how many epochs you wish to use to train the model, for that, a new window will appear.

After this you will once again be able to test the model.



## Efficiency

For this model I have found that the best result is obtained using 10 epochs, but you are welcome to try it with other cases.
